            <p>
                We want you to know your rights and our rights and so we have prepared this agreement ("user agreement" or "agreement") between 
                GrokBB, LLC ("we", "our," "us") and you. This agreement sets the terms of your use of the GrokBB website and services ("GrokBB") 
                that include boards, messaging, and any other service we provide. This agreement is meant to encourage a fair and tolerant place 
                for ideas, people, links, and discussion.
            </p>
    
            <h4><strong>The Legal Stuff</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                This agreement is a legal contract between you and us. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by 
                the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use GrokBB. Please take a look at GrokBB's 
                <a href="<?php echo SITE_BASE_URL; ?>/home/privacy">privacy policy</a> too. It explains how we collect and use your information.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Your Access to GrokBB</strong></h4>
            
            <p>
                Without advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement or for any other reason we choose: (1) suspend 
                your access to GrokBB, (2) suspend or terminate Your Account, and/or (3) remove any of your User Content from GrokBB.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We reserve the right to monitor GrokBB, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do 
                not guarantee we will monitor at all.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>GrokBB is for your personal, lawful use</strong></h4>
            
            <p>
                GrokBB is designed and supported for personal use only. You may not use GrokBB to break the law, violate an individual's privacy, 
                or infringe any person or entity’s intellectual property or any other proprietary rights.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>GrokBB is for fun</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                GrokBB is intended to be a place for your entertainment. We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on something you read on GrokBB.
            </p>
    
            <h4><strong>GrokBB isn't intended as a marketplace</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                GrokBB is not intended to be a marketplace for any goods or services. However, you may find commercial links, coupons, deals, advertisements and 
                other third-party offers on GrokBB. GrokBB is not a party to, nor in any way responsible for, any transactions you have with these third parties. 
                For this reason, any transactions you undertake are your responsibility alone, so be careful.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You may not use GrokBB to conduct transactions for any illegal goods or services.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Your GrokBB Account</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                To participate on GrokBB, you must create an account that includes a username and password ("Your Account") and, if you want to be able to reset 
                your password or have us contact you, an email address as well. Of course, you can also browse GrokBB without logging in.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.
            </p>

            <p>

            <h4><strong>Payment Information</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                You may also submit your debit or credit card information ("Payment Information") via the website to purchase services via GrokBB. GrokBB uses third 
                party service providers to process your payment information. If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and 
                you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes any applicable taxes, fees, and charges to GrokBB or one of our 
                service providers. 
            </p>
    
            <h4><strong>GrokBB Content</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                GrokBB contains graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio, software, code, website compilation, and website "look and feel" supplied by us or 
                our licensors, which we call "GrokBB content." GrokBB content is protected by intellectual property laws including copyright and other proprietary 
                rights of the United States and foreign countries.
            </p>

            <p>
                We grant you the right to access the GrokBB content in the manner described in this agreement. You may not otherwise make unauthorized commercial use 
                of, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display GrokBB content, except as permitted by the doctrine of fair 
                use or as authorized in writing by us.
            </p>
    
            <h4><strong>Your Content</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                You retain the rights to your copyrighted content or information that you submit to GrokBB ("user content") except as described below.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By submitting user content to GrokBB, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, 
                prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, 
                and to authorize others to do so.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You agree that you have the right to submit anything you post, and that your user content does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any 
                other personal or proprietary right of any other party.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Please take a look at GrokBB's <a href="<?php echo SITE_BASE_URL; ?>/home/privacy">privacy policy</a> for an explanation of how we may use or share 
                information submitted by you or collected from you.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>GrokBB does not endorse user content</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any user content submitted by you to GrokBB.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Links and GrokBB</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                GrokBB is a place with many third-party hyperlinks posted by users like you. We are not responsible for the content or actions of any third party websites 
                or services associated with posted links. You agree to take sole legal responsibility for any links you post, and neither this agreement nor our privacy policy 
                applies to any content on other websites related to those links. You should consult the terms and privacy policies of those other websites to understand your 
                rights.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Board Rules</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                Boards may create their own rules and enforce them as they see fit, providing they do not violate the terms of this agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
                You agree that GrokBB is not responsible for the actions taken or not taken by moderators or board owners.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Don't spam the GrokBB community</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                You may not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that we deem to be junk or spam. Cluttering GrokBB with this sort 
                of content reduces the quality of the GrokBB experience for others.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Don't misuse GrokBB</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                You agree not to interrupt the serving of GrokBB, introduce malicious code onto GrokBB, make it difficult for anyone else to use GrokBB due to your actions, 
                attempt to manipulate users or GrokBB's systems, or assist anyone in misusing GrokBB in any way.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Children and GrokBB</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                GrokBB is not directed at people under the age of 13, and GrokBB does not knowingly collect any personal information from such people. 
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>Copyright and the DMCA</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                We will respond to legitimate requests under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and we retain the right to remove user content on GrokBB that 
                we deem to be infringing the copyright of others. If you become aware of user content on GrokBB that infringes your copyright rights, you may submit a 
                properly formatted DMCA request (see 17 U.S.C. § 512) to GrokBB.
            </p>

            <p>
                Misrepresentations of infringement can result in liability for monetary damages. You may want to consult an attorney before taking any action pursuant to the DMCA.
            </p>
            
            <h4><strong>A Few More Legalities</strong></h4>
            
            <p>
                Each of the following sections applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Where jurisdictions do not allow 
                disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, the contents of this section may not apply.
            </p>
            
            <div class="uk-margin-large-left">
                <h4><strong>Indemnity</strong></h4>
    
                <p>
                    All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to GrokBB remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you 
                    will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Specifically, you agree to hold GrokBB, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and 
                    defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or 
                    related to your access to or use of GrokBB, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.
                </p>
                
                <h4><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></h4>
    
                <p>
                    GrokBB is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service 
                    providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a 
                    particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or 
                    electronic. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content. We do not 
                    guarantee that GrokBB will always work properly.
                </p>
                
                <h4><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></h4>
    
                <p>
                    We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or 
                    any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use GrokBB, including (but not 
                    limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of 
                    the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for 
                    incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims, 
                    demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way 
                    connected to your use of GrokBB.
                </p>
                
                <h4><strong>Governing Law</strong></h4>
    
                <p>
                    The headings in this agreement are for convenience and do not control any of its provisions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to this user agreement, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the 
                    State of Washington without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. We agree and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the 
                    state and federal court located in King County, Washington.
                </p>
                
                <h4><strong>Severability and Enforcement</strong></h4>
    
                <p>
                    If any provision of this user agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it 
                    enforceable without losing its intent. If no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from the rest of this agreement.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If we do not enforce any right or provision in this user agreement, that is not to be deemed a waiver of our right to do so in the future.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h4><strong>Changes</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                This user agreement is the entire agreement between you and us concerning GrokBB. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and 
                us. We may modify this user agreement at any time. If we make changes to this agreement we will let you know by revising the Last Updated date at the top 
                of the agreement. If we make a change to this agreement that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will provide you with additional notice (such as 
                posting a topic about it, or sending a board announcement, in <a href="<?php echo SITE_BASE_URL; ?>/g/GrokBB_Dev">GrokBB Dev</a>). By continuing to use 
                GrokBB after a change to this agreement, you agree to those changes.
