                <ul>
                    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li>
                    <li>Help protect the safety of GrokBB and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing our <a href="<?php echo SITE_BASE_URL; ?>/home/terms">User Agreement</a>;</li>
                    <li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices and other support and administrative messages;</li>
                    <li>Provide customer service; and</li>
                    <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;</li>

            <h4><strong>How We Share Information</strong></h4>
    
            <p>
                When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When you submit a topic or reply to the Services, visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see the content of 
                        your topics and replies, the username associated with your topics or replies, your reputation and badges, and the date and 
                        time you submitted or updated the topic or reply. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, 
                        they may become public (e.g., at the moderator's option in the case of private boards) and you should take that into 
                        consideration before posting to the Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you send private messages, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, 
                        and the date and time the message was sent. The sender will also be able to see the date and time the recipient read the message.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, 
                        reputation, badges, how long you have been a member of the Services, and how many topics, replies and favorites you have.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Please note that, even if you delete a topic, reply or message you submit through the Services, they may still be viewable or available 
                    on our servers or to other users who have the proper permissions (e.g., moderators or GrokBB employees).
                </p>
    
                <p>
